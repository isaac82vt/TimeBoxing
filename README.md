What is timeboxing?
Timeboxing is a simple time management technique that involves allotting a fixed, maximum unit of time for an activity in advance, and then complete the activity within that time frame.

The concept was first introduced by James Martin, the author of the book Rapid Application Development, as a part of agile software development.

In gist, timeboxing is a time management technique where you allocate a fixed time period to a planned activity. You work on the activity during the fixed time period and stop working on it once the time is up - then, you assess whether you've reached your planned goals.

You can use this approach to handle your project management tasks or manage your personal errands.
